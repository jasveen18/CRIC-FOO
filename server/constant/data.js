        title: `English Cricket Chiefs Give "Conditional Approval" For Ashes Tour`,
        author: `Agence France-Presse`,
        description: `England's Ashes tour of Australia is set to go ahead after the England and Wales Cricket Board gave "conditional approval" to the trip on Friday. There were fears the Ashes would be cancelled after months of concern over tough Covid-19 quarantine guidelines which England's players and their families will have to follow in Australia. England Test captain Joe Root last week sparked fresh doubts about the tour when he refused to confirm he would tour Australia. But the five-match series is now set to start as scheduled in December following talks between Cricket Australia, the ECB and England's players this week.`,

Speaking after Rahul led PBKS to a six-wicket victory over Chennai Super Kings (CSK) with a blistering knock of 98 not out off 42 deliveries in an Indian Premier League (IPL) 2021 clash in Dubai on Thursday, Gambhir said the 29-year-old India cricketer may possess "more ability than Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma". Gambhir added that had Rahul batted throughout this IPL campaign the way he did on Thursday, PBKS would have made the cut for the playoffs.`,
